** Video - A youtube video
   - can contain several songs
** Song - A published work of music
   - Can be in different videos
   - Can have many different routines
** Routine (Dance) - A set of moves to do along to a song (or video)
   - With a song this can be done to any video containing that song
   - When connected to a video without a song implies a yoga, weight, pilates, etc routine
** Verse (prayer? flow?) - A short set of moves
   - Designed to be repeatable (eg "do this every chorus of this song")
   - Can containe repeated sub elements (eg "moves 1-4 are step, squat, step, squat" and "repeat 1-4" then "repeat 1-4" etc)
** Motion!?!??!
   - Do I want to have a intermediate between verse and pose?
   - This would be something like "outward heart" or "hammer curl"
   - Without this an IC heart would have to be a whole verse or be reconstructed every time
** Pose - A position the body can hold
   - Downward dog, IC proud lizard, IC-Y, etc
** Sub Pose - pose for individual limbs
   - Ed "right arm under chin"
   - We might want to cut out pose and have a motion be a series of sub-poses
** Performance - A user did a thing
   - FK to video
   - FK to user
   - data field with map to completion, progress, etc
